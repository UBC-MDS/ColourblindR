# ColourblindR
An R package that creates colourblind friendly themes.


# Project 

`Colourblind8` will be a brand new theme package implemented for `ggplot2` to optimize graphs into a format interpretable by people with colourblindness. Colourblindness, also known as colour vision deficiency, is a condition that affects individuals how they perceive colours visually. According to colourblindawareness.org, colourblindness affects 1 in every 12 men and 1 in every 200 women globally. The package is inspired by the fact that people without knowledge about this condition don't know how to make their graphs accesible. Our objective is to enhance data visualization by implementing proper colours so that the graphs are perceived correctly by all readers as intended.

# Scope

At this stage, `Colourblind8` will focus on developing settings for the three most prevalent colourblind perspectives - protanopia, deuteranopes and tritanopes (see Appendix for more information on the types of colourblindness).
